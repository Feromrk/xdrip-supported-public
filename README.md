# xdrip-supported (created 2020, not maintained)


I wanted to learn Javascript, [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), so I came up with this small project.

This repo contains the source code of [https://xdrip-supported.web.app/#/](https://xdrip-supported.web.app/#/).

Idea: Make functioning [xDrip+](https://github.com/jamorham/xDrip-plus) app settings (together with android settings) publicly available. <br>
Background: xDrip+ app functionality was regularely broken by android updates (several years ago, propably has changed by now).

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
